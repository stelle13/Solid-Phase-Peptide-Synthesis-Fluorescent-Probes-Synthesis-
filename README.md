This folder contains a brief summary of organic synthesis and chemical biology experiments conducted during the Summer and Fall 2025 semesters at Yonsei University’s Department of Chemistry and College of Pharmacy.

The organic probe synthesis at the Department of Chemistry was performed as part of the Advanced Chemistry Major Experiment—a graduation requirement—during the 2025 summer break. This project was carried out over approximately three weeks at the [Biopolymer Lab](https://biopolymer.yonsei.ac.kr/index.php) under the guidance of a Ph.D. candidate mentor. 

The peptide synthesis and purification experiments at the College of Pharmacy were conducted as an undergraduate intern in Professor YoungSoo Kim’s [Laboratory of Chemical Biology](https://chembio.yonsei.ac.kr/) during the Fall 2025 semester. As of December 2025, these experiments are still ongoing.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Ph.D. candidates who guided me throughout these projects. Beyond the technical skills, I gained invaluable insights into the mindset and life of a researcher.
